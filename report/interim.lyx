Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The projects main objectives can be summarised by one sentence - to mimic
 how a person would learn to fly and operate a small remote control helicopter
 in an indoor environment.
 This objective is an interesting one, as it can be split into key areas
 of focus, each providing an engineering challenge, and then they all need
 to be combined to create the finished product.
 The problem is best described by the limiting factors - we have a room
 indoors, a small remote-controlled helicopter, a computer and a simple
 camera source capable of estimating depth to some degree of accuracy.
 With these boundaries, the final aim is to have the computer learn to fly
 the helicopter, and given goals from a human, enact them correctly.
 The difficulties are in the details - how exactly does one learn to fly
 a helicopter? How will we reliably get positional information for the helicopte
r in the room? These are just a few of the potential problems.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Deconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step is to try and separate the individual programming problems
 into a way that is easily reasoned about.
 Once they have been divided, research can be done on the specific problems,
 and tools can be created to start tackling the problems at hand.
 For instance, the computer vision problem is entirely different from that
 of the machine learning - the machine operates under the assumption that
 the positional information is mostly accurate, and it is up to the computer
 vision module to provide these mostly accurate readings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Mimicry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I decided to tackle this problem by thinking about how a human would go
 about it, reducing it to the key problems and then thinking about how a
 machine could go about tackling them.
 The final project will be split into modules, each providing a different
 role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Complexity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest place to see the complexity in this project is by looking at
 the computer vision aspect.
 Initially I will try to deal with the simplest case - that of a purely
 virtualised environment with completely controlled variables - no computer
 vision required.
 Then, for the first step, I will try to work in 1 dimension only, that
 is up and down.
 This restricts the vision to 1 dimension also, tracking the movement of
 a blob up and down.
 Expanding this to 2 dimensions should not be as much of a problem from
 the computer vision perspective, but requires increased complexity of the
 AI itself - it needs to know 
\begin_inset Formula $how$
\end_inset

 a helicopter moves forward and backwards, using the main propellor for
 upwards and forwards thrust.
 Expanding to 3 dimensions provides even more challenges - from navigating
 a 3 dimension environment (obtaining depth information and object awareness)
 to reasoning about the movements of a helicopter in a 3D environment.
