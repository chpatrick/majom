\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The projects main objectives can be summarised by one sentence - to mimic
 how a person would learn to fly and operate a small remote control helicopter
 in an indoor environment.
 This objective is an interesting one, as it can be split into key areas
 of focus, each providing an engineering challenge, and then they all need
 to be combined to create the finished product.
 The problem is best described by the limiting factors - we have a room
 indoors, a small remote-controlled helicopter, a computer and a simple
 camera source capable of estimating depth to some degree of accuracy.
 With these boundaries, the final aim is to have the computer learn to fly
 the helicopter, and given goals from a human, enact them correctly.
 The difficulties are in the details - how exactly does one learn to fly
 a helicopter? How will we reliably get positional information for the helicopte
r in the room? These are just a few of the potential problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Deconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step is to try and separate the individual programming problems
 into a way that is easily reasoned about.
 Once they have been divided, research can be done on the specific problems,
 and tools can be created to start tackling the problems at hand.
 For instance, the computer vision problem is entirely different from that
 of the machine learning - the machine operates under the assumption that
 the positional information is mostly accurate, and it is up to the computer
 vision module to provide these mostly accurate readings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Mimicry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I decided to tackle this problem by thinking about how a human would go
 about it, reducing it to the key problems and then thinking about how a
 machine could go about tackling them.
 The final project will be split into modules, each providing a different
 role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Complexity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest place to see the complexity in this project is by looking at
 the computer vision aspect.
 Initially I will try to deal with the simplest case - that of a purely
 virtualised environment with completely controlled variables - no computer
 vision required.
 Then, for the first step, I will try to work in 1 dimension only, that
 is up and down.
 This restricts the vision to 1 dimension also, tracking the movement of
 a blob up and down.
 Expanding this to 2 dimensions should not be as much of a problem from
 the computer vision perspective, but requires increased complexity of the
 AI itself - it needs to know 
\begin_inset Formula $how$
\end_inset

 a helicopter moves forward and backwards, using the main propellor for
 upwards and forwards thrust.
 Expanding to 3 dimensions provides even more challenges - from navigating
 a 3 dimension environment (obtaining depth information and object awareness)
 to reasoning about the movements of a helicopter in a 3D environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Computer Vision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed above, there are a multitude of tasks that need to be performed
 from a vision perspective before the overall aims can be realised.
 I aim to start from as simplified as possible, simply tracking an object
 on a 2D white background, and then from this gradually iterate the vision
 module, adding extra functionality and dimensions.
 Each iteration will present its own challenges, from getting depth information
 to tracking orientation of the helicopter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Machine Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AI that flies the helicopter is wholly separate from the vision, and
 instead is supposed to recreate the learning aspects of the abstract idea
 of a helicopter.
 Its key requirement is to know exactly how to fly the helicopter, given
 information about the current whereabouts, and know how to act upon the
 orders that it is given.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Technology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To aid the realisation of the aims, I plan to use some

 This will allow me to focus on the project as the whole.

Project plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project as a whole can be split into multiple stages, and each of these
 stages is composed of discrete parts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Milestones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the key things that need to be done - these milestones define
 the project as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Technology research and foundation implementations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I begin doing any programming, I have to research the technologies
 that I am going to use, and see how they will all fit together.
 This includes finding documentation for the technologies, learning to use
 them, and judging their usefulness.
 Additionally, there are several parts of the project that are essential
 and must be implemented as a 'foundation' before I can even begin any work
 at all!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Back-engineering the RC protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To control the remote control helicopter from a computer, it was essential
 to be able to accurately replicate the signal that is sent from the normal
 stock controller.
 There were a variety of sources on the internet that had already done things
 similar to this before, so I was able to get a rough idea of where to start
 from there, and then performed my own experimentation to see what was best.
 In addition to just figuring out how the protocol worked, I had to think
 of a way to actually send the signal to the helicopter! I did some research
 online, and decided to use an Arduino board.
 After some fiddling around with the Arduino language, I was able to create
 a simple circuit that could send pulses to the helicopter.
 From here it was just playing around with different variations of the protocol
 to see which one worked best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Tool creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point I had to create the basic tools with which I would create
 the finished product.
 These included the interface from the AI to the Arduino, a GUI so I could
 manually control the helicopter from the computer, and a simulation environment
 so I could play around with the AI in a controlled environment before trying
 it on the real thing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Monkey
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I decided to name the AI a 'Monkey', as I figured that would fit in with
 the mimicry motto 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monkey see, monkey do
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The monkey had to be able to replicate how a human would learn to fly a
 helicopter.
 At the simplest level, the monkey operates under the knowledge of the current
 position of the helicopter in 3D space, and the time of that observation.
 The monkey does not worry exactly how this position is found, it just works
 on how to fly the helicopter from the information that it is receiving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Vision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vision part is responsible for obtaining a reliable and quick value
 for the current position of the helicopter in 3D space, as well as (later
 on) providing other spacial information that might be relevant.
 I'll start simple, doing basic shape detection on a plain background in
 2D, and then later on try to expand this to 3D by getting depth information
 and try to get orientation information about the helicopter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
