simulate basic physics environment, analogy to helicopter
  - ensure have abstract interfaces
  - attach to GUI to visualize
  - attach to flyer
  - test in multiple scenarios (changing thrust / conditions)

reverse engineer helicopter
  - get parts
  - send basic commands to helicopter
  - attach to GUI with button/key commands
  - fly helicopter from computer

create simple vision software to track helicopter on plain background
  - fabricate test environment
  - locate helicopter
  - fly manually and get movement and position statistics about helicopter

combine vision and controller
  - get helicopter to take off
  - get helicopter to hover
  - get helicopter to land
  - specify height and positions, interact

extend!
  - ???
