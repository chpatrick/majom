-- The idea is that the controller has no idea exactly how much force is exerted
-- from the helicopter for the inputs, it just knows that the function is 
-- monotonically increasing and continuous. It has to learn the function from
-- observing the helicopter.

-- What it has to work with:
-- 1 - It can observe the helicopter at any time
-- 2 - Power -> Acceleration is monotonic increasing
-- 3 - Power -> Acceleration is continuous
-- 4 - Simple case, environment forces are constant
--   - Complex case, environment forces are not constant
--
-- Needs to be able to iteratively come to an approximation of the 
-- Power -> Acceleration function, changing as new input comes in (adaptive).
