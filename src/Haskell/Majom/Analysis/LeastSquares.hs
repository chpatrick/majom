-- | LeastSquares instantiation of the Model. Not really useful for
-- step by step learning, better for observing the making a one 
-- time judgement. Useful maybe for testing?

-- Should try doing it in X segments - or take from a wide sampling
-- range? Keep sampling, removing if more 'varied' one appears or
-- if it gets too old - say after 10 seconds or so?
--
-- Hmmm... guess I'll do this tomorrow - maybe sketch it out and
-- see how it works. Store the structure and stuff in the data
-- type.
